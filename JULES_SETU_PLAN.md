# SETU - Documentation, Testing & Quality Assurance Plan for Jules

## Context
Setu has undergone major improvements with authentication refactoring, new CLI commands, enhanced configuration models, and expanded test coverage. The core functionality is working, but we need comprehensive documentation, testing validation, and quality assurance to make this production-ready.

## Your Mission: Polish Setu for Production Readiness

You're handling the critical final phase work that ensures Setu is production-ready, well-documented, and thoroughly tested.
